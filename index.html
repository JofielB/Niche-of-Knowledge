                In this blog, you will find everything I have learned in the Academy program of Nearsoft by Encora. 
                All this new knowledge comes from different videos and readings that I have gone through in this program (if you want you can watch the videos and read the readings yourself, I will put the link for each one).
                The blog is structured by the different months of the program and their respective weeks so you can have a better perspective of how my path of knowledge has been.

                <b>How to Talk to Anyone </b>: This reading is like a review of the book; How to
                Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes and in this reading you can find the things
                that the author of those notes thought that were more important from the
                book. I must say that I am not pretty good at talking with other people so this 
                reading comes really handy to me. All the points that you can see below are the 
                ones that I want to start applying in my own life because I think that they can 
                really help me in the process of talking with new people.

                        It is important to know even how to smile. It is not recommended to
                        always smile immediately when you know a new person, you have to
                        wait for the perfect moment to give it a more genuine smile. Doing 
                        in this way you will ensure that the other will feel your smile like 
                        something more genuine and not just a normal gesture that will be ignored

                        important thing is to make the program to work properly and you
                        have to make the code as simple as possible and don’t use a complex
                        algorithm because it may help do the task more quickly but it makes
                        it harder to maintain and expand that code.

                <b>X Workflow</b>: 
                Well, this reading is like a recommendation about how to do your work in a 
                more properly efficient way, the lecture talks about the different phases 
                that you need to go through to tackle all the problems in a better way. I 
                really liked all these recommendations because I totally agreed with them, 
                when you are trying to resolve a problem first you have to find what’s the 
                problem and then you have to give a proper analysis to the problem
                ( discovery,  Hypothesis, Definition, Specification, Implementation, 
                Analysis and Planning for the Future) and not just jump immediately to do the 
                thing that you suppose will resolve the problem, only when you have made the 
                proper analysis you can go to the next phase and this is something that you need 
                to do for all phases you need to take the proper time and advance one step at a 
                time to work and resolve the problems in a better way.

                learned more about how the shell works. I already knew the basics of it, 
                that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the path variables and
                the shell are connected and I found it pretty cool, now I know

                <b>Creative thinking hacks</b>: This was a pretty interesting talk; I really like
                how this dude sees creativity like something you can work on and not
                something magical that sometimes you have and other times is gone and is
                when you feel “blocked”. Other things that I take from this talk are all
                the advices or hacks that he gave to know you more and work in a way that's
                the best for you and to increase your creativity. I really liked this talk
                because for much time I had the idea that creativity is something that you
                have or not and by now I am going to start working on my own creativity
                because it is something that is very important to have (at least for me).

                        for success you really need to see yourself, to see where you are
                        and how much power you have to success in your goal, if your
                        current power is not enough you need to crave from ways to earn
                        more power or to have smaller goal that require less power which

                        failing is learning, try new ways to tackle the problem until you

                and with experience, you will be able to have a better assumption of how to react 
                to different situations and be able to know how to implement this new knowledge in

                <b>Composition</b>: From my point of view the composition is kinda similar to the
                Inheritance because you use other class attributes and methods to fulfill a
                purpose but with the difference that the classes that you use are not
                attached to the classes that use them. For example, if you have the method
                or process of walk in the Persona class and you want to use that method in
                a class called Alumno you only instantiate the class Persona on the Alumno
                class and use the methods or attributes that you need in this way the
                Alumno class is not directed attached to the class Persona.

                        Abstraction: This consists in obtaining the more particular or
                        general attributes from an object and creating a class in base of
                        them. Is very important to just abstract the more essential
                        attributes of a class to make it possible to use in many
                        situations.

                        Encapsulation: The encapsulation make reference to the liberty that
                        other classes have to access to the attributes and methods of the
                        other classes, for example if you are using a class called people
                        you will be able to access to its public methods or attributes, for
                        example let's said that the class has a attribute name and is
                        public you will be able to use it but if the class has an attribute
                        called id and is private your will not be able to use it.

                        because to have polymorphism is necessary to have inheritance. For
                        example, if you have a class called Car with the basic attributes
                        and methods that a car could have you can create a class called
                        Bocho or Troca that could inherit the basic methods and attributes
                        that a car has and implement them in its own way. In this way all
                        the cars would have the same methods but implemented in different
                        ways or forms.

                <b>The Myth of the Genius Programmer</b>: To me the principal point of this talk
                is to make you see that the perfect programmer doesn’t exist, there is no
                such people that can write perfect programs at the first try and never make
                a mistake so you don’t have to fear to fail and that people see you how you
                fail.

                I really like this talk because I really have that feeling that all the
                thing I do have to be perfect or at least work as there are supposed to in
                the first try but not because I fear to make a mistake is more about the
                fear of don’t be to the expectation but well the things that the talk are
                pretty true, you don’t be perfect at the first try and you don’t have to be
                just keep trying and you fail that’s good, that means that there are thing
                that you can improve and now know that you fail you know what thing you
                need to improve.

                explaining the basic concepts of the transition of information, it explains
                how all start with the creation of the telegraph and the invention of the

                <b>Programming well with others</b>: I really enjoy this talk.This talk because
                its was kinda different to other talks because they are answering like some
                questions about some problems that came when you are working in a team but
                most of the question are focused on how things are when you are working
                with people, when you work with a team, how to collaborate with people that
                collaborate with you but are outside of your team and they talk about how
                to talk to other people that are not directly resalionate with the project

                <b>Developing Expertise</b>: From this talk I had like how is the path of becoming
                an expert. We all start like a novice in the new things. We don't have to
                treat us like if we were experts since the beginning of the path and this
                is maybe something too hard to see because we usually follow instructions
                of an expert level but to follow that instruccion how they are supposed to
                you need a lot of experience.

                <b>Perfection is an unrealistic goal</b>: This talk was really uhm calm I must
                said, I really liked the topic because I feel that the things that are said
                I can use it not just in my work environment. How she says and the end,
                don't try to dry a swap just kill the alligator. I really like that
                perspective of seeing things, like in a more relaxed and agile way, is good
                to want it all but be calm, plant the things and one little step at a time.
                This is something that I am gonna try to implement in my life.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                And I also like how she talks about the pomodoro technique, I am starting
                to think that I should try it because I am starting to see that
                recommendations in a lot of places.

                <b>The power of an Agile Mindset</b>: I must say that the thing that I like the
                most from this talk is the way she sees the goals. I feel that she sees
                them as something that is possible, it doesn't matter what your goal is and
                how you are, the only thing that really matters is what you want and what
                you are gonna do to achieve it because even the more regular person could
                achieve big things. This thing is the thing that I like the most about this
                talk and is a perspective that I am gonna take for me and my goals.

                <b>Everything is a remix(set of videos)</b>: Everything is a remix, new ideas come
                from old one and all new things are inspirations from their ancestors. The
                idea that ths video plant is something pretty interesting, the way that he
                sees the act of copying something is pretty interesting, I had never
                thought that copying something and transforming it can be something good
                because it can lead to innovation, and I am actually starting to think how
                could I apply this? How to copy and transform the things? and should I let
                others know the ideas or things I create? Because the copy of my own ideas

                <b>Missing semester</b>: This was a pretty good video and reading. I really learned
                more about how the shell works. I already knew the basics of the shell,
                that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the pat variables and
                the shell are connected and I found pretty that pretty cool, now I know
                that I am stalling sqlite(for example) and use the command sqlite3 in my
                cmd and I receive a message saying that the command is unrecognizable it

                <b>Test-Driven Development:</b> I have a struggle reading this article because at
                first I didn't understand the structure of the article but after reading it
                several times I kinda understand it. This article is focused on something
                called TDD that is like some kind of way of doing agile testing of the
                software you are developing, It tells you that you need to create the test
                before doing the software, and it tells some recommendations about how to
                do that.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Most parts of the reading give some recommendations about how to perform
                testing in your programs, and I have never done any testing in my programs
                but after reading this I would like to test some of these things.

                <b>Mocks Aren't Stubs:</b> This reading was a pretty good way to join all the
                different concepts of the different reading of testing and makes more clear
                how they work and I finally can see how you implement them and use them in
                a particular case until now I have only seen them in a theoretical way but
                in this reading have the opportunity to see a real example of testing in
                java.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I must say that this reading was kinda difficult to follow because I have
                zero experience in testing and here we see different ways of making
                testing. Here I have an introduction to what area the Doubles are. For what
                I get the doubles is like a way of calling a test that simulates the
                behavior of something to test its function but the thing that is more
                focused this talks is the mock objects, these ones are like a particular
                kind of Double because it behaves differently in some parts of the testing
                (sequence: setup, exercise, verify and teardown). In the verification part,
                the mocks do different things that the other Doubles, they make the
                verification trough behavior and not for a state like the other kinds of
                Double and I believe that this is because the Mock makes a totally copy of
                a class to be able to recreate its behavior and not only read its state
                when is tested.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                From this reading I could understand better how the testing works, and
                there's still much to learn about them because it is something totally new
                to me but I am eager to understand them more and even be able to use and
                create the different types of testing.

                <b>Vim:</b> This reading was focused on the text editor Vim. In this lecture, I
                could learn a lot about this particular text editor and I must say that the
                concept of Vim is pretty interesting because the philosophy of this text
                editor is that you don't have to use any other thing that your keyboard to
                programma, that means; not use your mouse or even your arrow keys because
                these things will only slow you down in your programming task. I must say
                that I found pretty interesting this text editor because it looks like a
                real challenge to dominate it but it seems like it really payout once you
                have dominated.

                particular text editor because it looks like something fun.

                <b>Version Control:</b> Pretty good reading. I must say that I have been using Git
                but like in this image:
            </p>

            <p dir="ltr">
                But after this reading, I really understand a little better how is that Git
                actually works and It makes me feel that a lot of things have more logic,
                for example, I didn't know that the commits are something immutable but
                know it makes sense why when you are trying to change something from a
                commit it is needed to create another new commit and it is impossible to
                edit an existing commit.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I also like that this reading has a lot of commands and its respective
                explanation, I am actually storing that part for use for reference when I
                forget something or for when I encounter a problem.

                <b>Bret Victor - The Future of Programming:</b> This talk starts with a thought
                that makes me think. He shows some examples about how technology advances
                in a pretty fast way but we advance in a pretty slow step and I must say
                that that can be actually true, most of the time we struggle a lot when
                something new comes and it demands us to change the way we see and do
                nothing but if we know that accepting these new technologies we would be
                able to accept them and change our self to evolve at the same time that
                technologies? I don't really know if that is possible but when the times
                come I will be open to these new changes and try to adopt them as quickly
                as possible.

                video the guy talks about how important is to have an immediate
                representation of what you are doing because it will help you a lot in your
                process of creating something, reducing the time in which you have an idea
                and see actually how it looks will make your creativity more active.
                Another thing that is pretty important when you are creating something new
                is that you don't have to imagine what you are doing, or at least is not
                recommended, because you are using a lot of concentration or brain capacity

                <b>Moonshot Thinking from Astro Teller:</b> It's pretty awesome to watch this type
                of video, it really gives me a different perspective about things. This
                perspective of sean and doing the things sounds like something fun, I would
                love to work with that mentality of creating projects that inspired me and
                don't have to worry about how I will make that that give me money it truly
                sound like a fantasy but I think I am gonna start believing in Santa (how
                the guy say in the video). I am gonna start to give this perspective to my
                personal projects, I really feel that it will make the things more fun and
                even I think it would help me to be more creative at the moment in the
                things or projects that I really want to work on.

                <b>What Got You Here Won't Get You There:</b> This talk was pretty interesting
                because it focused on how to improve the behavior of people that have
                already succeeded. I must say that I correlational this talk with a lot of
                the things that I learned from the book of the “Ego is the Enemy” because
                the first thing that I see is that the problem of the people that success
                is that its Ego makes them look like they are able to do everything and
                that anyone should follow their way and well that's something that is wrong
                because, well, the ego is the enemy. And after seeing this video I think
                that the best way to keep succeeding is by don't let your ego or your
                success consume you, Is good to feel proud of what you have archive but it
                is good to remember that there is always something new to learn, and a
                better way to do the things, we can always improve ourself and our ways of
                doing things.

                <b>Measure of Measure:</b> This video opens with the experiment of the two slits
                and the electrons like the last video but here the guy explained in a more
                bast way. I must say that the last video helped me a lot to understand the
                explanation of this experiment. He talks more about what are these the
                waves or interference patterns that the electrons made when you put the two
                lines, he explains that this pattern that the electrons made is like a
                representation of the probability of where the electron could be when it
                hits the wall. I don't know if I understand that in the correct way but it
                is a pretty cool phenomenon, it is like the representation of probability
                and the more interesting thing is how this probability changes when we try
                to measure it. This whole behavior of the electrons and the quantum realm
                is totally mysterious but a really interesting one.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                In the rest of the video, the guy introduces some experts on the topic and
                they talk more about this particular phenomenon that happens when we try to
                measure the behavior of the electron. I must say that the talk becomes a
                little too complex and I wasn't able to understand everything but from all
                this talk I understand a little more how this phenomenon occurs and I must
                say that I am pretty excited about that because this is a topic that I
                found interesting and be able to understand it a little more day by day is
                something that truly puts a smile on my face.

                <b>The Quantum Conspiracy:</b> This talk has a pretty different approach than the
                other videos about quantum physics. The guy from this video tries to give
                like a different approach to the different myths (as he says) of quantum
                physics. He gives a different way of seeing the things, for example, he
                opens with the experiment of the slits and tries to explain how the
                interference occurs and how the mere act of try to measure this experiment
                will break the interference pattern because if you put some kind of
                observer the electron will know in some time of form and it will take a
                particular value.

                This video is a pretty good video that can help you to go deeper into this
                topic of the quantum world and the behavior of this, I will take it to
                count if in the future I want to learn in a deeper way all these
                principles.

                must say that I have always found this topic pretty interesting but for a
