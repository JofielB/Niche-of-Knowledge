                In this blog, you will find everything I have learned in the Academy program of Nearsoft by Encora.
                All this new knowledge comes from different videos and readings that I have gone through in this program
                (if you want you can watch the videos and read the readings yourself, I will put the link for each one).
                The blog is structured by the different months of the program and their respective weeks so you can have
                a better perspective of how my path of knowledge has been.

                Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes and in this reading you can find the things
                that the author of those notes thought that were more important from the
                book. I must say that I am not pretty good at talking with other people so this
                reading comes really handy to me. All the points that you can see below are the

                        always smile immediately when you know a new person, you have to
                        wait for the perfect moment to give it a more genuine smile. Doing
                        in this way you will ensure that the other will feel your smile like
                        something more genuine and not just a normal gesture that will be ignored

                        Simplicity not speed: When you are working on a program the most
                        important thing is to make the program to work properly and you
                        have to make the code as simple as possible and don’t use a complex
                        algorithm because it may help do the task more quickly but it makes
                        it harder to maintain and expand that code.

                <b>X Workflow</b>:
                Well, this reading is like a recommendation about how to do your work in a
                more properly efficient way, the lecture talks about the different phases
                that you need to go through to tackle all the problems in a better way. I
                really liked all these recommendations because I totally agreed with them,
                when you are trying to resolve a problem first you have to find what’s the
                problem and then you have to give a proper analysis to the problem
                ( discovery, Hypothesis, Definition, Specification, Implementation,
                Analysis and Planning for the Future) and not just jump immediately to do the
                thing that you suppose will resolve the problem, only when you have made the
                proper analysis you can go to the next phase and this is something that you need
                to do for all phases you need to take the proper time and advance one step at a
                time to work and resolve the problems in a better way.

                that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the path variables and
                the shell are connected and I found it pretty cool, now I know
                that I am stalling sqlite(for example) and use the command sqlite3 in my
                cmd and I receive a message saying that the command is unrecognizable it
                may be a problem with the path variable.

                It is really impressive to get the notion that we all want or need to be
                part of a group because that is the best way to survive. And I really like

                people like a feeling that all believe the same stuff and that we are all
                part of the same boat can be really helpful to create and outstanding
                community. And I really like the tip of how to get rid of the people that

                how this dude sees creativity like something you can work on and not
                something magical that sometimes you have and other times is gone and is
                when you feel “blocked”. Other things that I take from this talk are all
                the advices or hacks that he gave to know you more and work in a way that's
                the best for you and to increase your creativity. I really liked this talk
                because for much time I had the idea that creativity is something that you
                have or not and by now I am going to start working on my own creativity

                        for success you really need to see yourself, to see where you are
                        and how much power you have to success in your goal, if your
                        current power is not enough you need to crave from ways to earn
                        more power or to have smaller goal that require less power which

                        failing is learning, try new ways to tackle the problem until you

                master something you have to do more than work on it for 10,000 hours, you

                and with experience, you will be able to have a better assumption of how to react
                to different situations and be able to know how to implement this new knowledge in
                the real life.

                <b>Composition</b>: From my point of view the composition is kinda similar to the
                Inheritance because you use other class attributes and methods to fulfill a
                purpose but with the difference that the classes that you use are not
                attached to the classes that use them. For example, if you have the method
                or process of walk in the Persona class and you want to use that method in
                a class called Alumno you only instantiate the class Persona on the Alumno
                class and use the methods or attributes that you need in this way the
                Alumno class is not directed attached to the class Persona.

                <b>The 4 Pillars of OOP</b>: Today I learned that there are 4 principles in the
                OOP paradigm. I have already known them but I didn’t know that they were
                called that way. These 4 pillars are like recommendations of how to take
                advantage of the OOP paradigm:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Abstraction: This consists in obtaining the more particular or
                        general attributes from an object and creating a class in base of
                        them. Is very important to just abstract the more essential
                        attributes of a class to make it possible to use in many
                        situations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Encapsulation: The encapsulation make reference to the liberty that
                        other classes have to access to the attributes and methods of the
                        other classes, for example if you are using a class called people
                        you will be able to access to its public methods or attributes, for
                        example let's said that the class has a attribute name and is
                        public you will be able to use it but if the class has an attribute
                        called id and is private your will not be able to use it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Inheritance: This is the ability to inherit the methods and
                        attributes from one class to another.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Polymorphism: This pillar is holding hands from the inheritance one
                        because to have polymorphism is necessary to have inheritance. For
                        example, if you have a class called Car with the basic attributes
                        and methods that a car could have you can create a class called
                        Bocho or Troca that could inherit the basic methods and attributes
                        that a car has and implement them in its own way. In this way all
                        the cars would have the same methods but implemented in different
                        ways or forms.

                <b>The Myth of the Genius Programmer</b>: To me the principal point of this talk
                is to make you see that the perfect programmer doesn’t exist, there is no
                such people that can write perfect programs at the first try and never make
                a mistake so you don’t have to fear to fail and that people see you how you
                fail.

                I really like this talk because I really have that feeling that all the
                thing I do have to be perfect or at least work as there are supposed to in
                the first try but not because I fear to make a mistake is more about the
                fear of don’t be to the expectation but well the things that the talk are
                pretty true, you don’t be perfect at the first try and you don’t have to be
                just keep trying and you fail that’s good, that means that there are thing
                that you can improve and now know that you fail you know what thing you
                need to improve.

                <b>Variable Length Codes</b>: This video teaches you about how the transition of

                explaining the basic concepts of the transition of information, it explains
                how all start with the creation of the telegraph and the invention of the

                something that is necessary to know, I think that the more you know how the
                transmission of the information works you will a have a better idea of how
                to make better applications that consume least recurse when transmitting
                any kind of data.

                <b>The Art of Organizational Manipulation</b>: This talk was really interesting
                because it focused on how to behave in a company. And I must say that it is
                pretty interesting that the kind of environment that they describe in the
                talk is pretty similar to the environment of Encora(Or at least I saw it
                like that) because they talk of an environment when you are free and
                responsible for yourself and your work.

                its was kinda different to other talks because they are answering like some
                questions about some problems that came when you are working in a team but
                most of the question are focused on how things are when you are working
                with people, when you work with a team, how to collaborate with people that
                collaborate with you but are outside of your team and they talk about how
                to talk to other people that are not directly resalionate with the project

                <b>Developing Expertise</b>: From this talk I had like how is the path of becoming
                an expert. We all start like a novice in the new things. We don't have to
                treat us like if we were experts since the beginning of the path and this
                is maybe something too hard to see because we usually follow instructions
                of an expert level but to follow that instruccion how they are supposed to
                you need a lot of experience.

                said, I really liked the topic because I feel that the things that are said
                I can use it not just in my work environment. How she says and the end,
                don't try to dry a swap just kill the alligator. I really like that
                perspective of seeing things, like in a more relaxed and agile way, is good
                to want it all but be calm, plant the things and one little step at a time.
                This is something that I am gonna try to implement in my life.

                them as something that is possible, it doesn't matter what your goal is and
                how you are, the only thing that really matters is what you want and what
                you are gonna do to achieve it because even the more regular person could
                achieve big things. This thing is the thing that I like the most about this

                because it can lead to innovation, and I am actually starting to think how
                could I apply this? How to copy and transform the things? and should I let

                <b>Missing semester</b>: This was a pretty good video and reading. I really learned
                more about how the shell works. I already knew the basics of the shell,
                that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the pat variables and
                the shell are connected and I found pretty that pretty cool, now I know
                that I am stalling sqlite(for example) and use the command sqlite3 in my
                cmd and I receive a message saying that the command is unrecognizable it
                may be a problem with the path variable.

                first I didn't understand the structure of the article but after reading it
                several times I kinda understand it. This article is focused on something
                called TDD that is like some kind of way of doing agile testing of the
                software you are developing, It tells you that you need to create the test
                before doing the software, and it tells some recommendations about how to
                do that.

                <b>Mocks Aren't Stubs:</b> This reading was a pretty good way to join all the
                different concepts of the different reading of testing and makes more clear
                how they work and I finally can see how you implement them and use them in
                a particular case until now I have only seen them in a theoretical way but
                in this reading have the opportunity to see a real example of testing in
                java.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I must say that this reading was kinda difficult to follow because I have
                zero experience in testing and here we see different ways of making
                testing. Here I have an introduction to what area the Doubles are. For what
                I get the doubles is like a way of calling a test that simulates the
                behavior of something to test its function but the thing that is more
                focused this talks is the mock objects, these ones are like a particular
                kind of Double because it behaves differently in some parts of the testing
                (sequence: setup, exercise, verify and teardown). In the verification part,
                the mocks do different things that the other Doubles, they make the
                verification trough behavior and not for a state like the other kinds of
                Double and I believe that this is because the Mock makes a totally copy of
                a class to be able to recreate its behavior and not only read its state
                when is tested.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                From this reading I could understand better how the testing works, and
                there's still much to learn about them because it is something totally new
                to me but I am eager to understand them more and even be able to use and
                create the different types of testing.

                <b>Vim:</b> This reading was focused on the text editor Vim. In this lecture, I
                could learn a lot about this particular text editor and I must say that the
                concept of Vim is pretty interesting because the philosophy of this text
                editor is that you don't have to use any other thing that your keyboard to
                programma, that means; not use your mouse or even your arrow keys because
                these things will only slow you down in your programming task. I must say
                that I found pretty interesting this text editor because it looks like a
                real challenge to dominate it but it seems like it really payout once you
                have dominated.

                <b>Version Control:</b> Pretty good reading. I must say that I have been using Git

                But after this reading, I really understand a little better how is that Git
                actually works and It makes me feel that a lot of things have more logic,
                for example, I didn't know that the commits are something immutable but
                know it makes sense why when you are trying to change something from a
                commit it is needed to create another new commit and it is impossible to
                edit an existing commit.

            <p dir="ltr">
                I also like that this reading has a lot of commands and its respective
                explanation, I am actually storing that part for use for reference when I
                forget something or for when I encounter a problem.

                <b>Bret Victor - The Future of Programming:</b> This talk starts with a thought
                that makes me think. He shows some examples about how technology advances
                in a pretty fast way but we advance in a pretty slow step and I must say
                that that can be actually true, most of the time we struggle a lot when
                something new comes and it demands us to change the way we see and do
                nothing but if we know that accepting these new technologies we would be
                able to accept them and change our self to evolve at the same time that
                technologies? I don't really know if that is possible but when the times
                come I will be open to these new changes and try to adopt them as quickly
                as possible.

                of the things that I have been seen and read in the past week, in this
                video the guy talks about how important is to have an immediate
                representation of what you are doing because it will help you a lot in your
                process of creating something, reducing the time in which you have an idea
                and see actually how it looks will make your creativity more active.
                Another thing that is pretty important when you are creating something new
                is that you don't have to imagine what you are doing, or at least is not
                recommended, because you are using a lot of concentration or brain capacity
                in thinking how the things you are doing will work or how they will look

                sound like a fantasy but I think I am gonna start believing in Santa (how
                the guy say in the video). I am gonna start to give this perspective to my

                <b>What Got You Here Won't Get You There:</b> This talk was pretty interesting
                because it focused on how to improve the behavior of people that have
                already succeeded. I must say that I correlational this talk with a lot of
                the things that I learned from the book of the “Ego is the Enemy” because
                the first thing that I see is that the problem of the people that success
                is that its Ego makes them look like they are able to do everything and
                that anyone should follow their way and well that's something that is wrong
                because, well, the ego is the enemy. And after seeing this video I think
                that the best way to keep succeeding is by don't let your ego or your
                success consume you, Is good to feel proud of what you have archive but it
                is good to remember that there is always something new to learn, and a
                better way to do the things, we can always improve ourself and our ways of
                doing things.

                be able to do in the future are pretty exciting. I wonder how the future of
                computing will be with this technology, it even makes me think that the
                future programmers may need to know a lot about physics to understand in a
                better way how to manipulate the data.

                <b>Dr. Quantum - Double Slit:</b> I must say that I have seen this experiment with
                a lot of different explanations but this is the first time that I truly
                understand what is going on. It explains pretty clearly how the wave
                behavior and the matter works. And then it shows you in a pretty clear way
                how the electrons have both behavior, a wave, and a matter.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                And by the end of the video, I only have one thought about the electrons
                and the world of quantum…

                <b>Measure of Measure:</b> This video opens with the experiment of the two slits
                and the electrons like the last video but here the guy explained in a more
                bast way. I must say that the last video helped me a lot to understand the
                explanation of this experiment. He talks more about what are these the
                waves or interference patterns that the electrons made when you put the two
                lines, he explains that this pattern that the electrons made is like a
                representation of the probability of where the electron could be when it
                hits the wall. I don't know if I understand that in the correct way but it
                is a pretty cool phenomenon, it is like the representation of probability
                and the more interesting thing is how this probability changes when we try
                to measure it. This whole behavior of the electrons and the quantum realm
                is totally mysterious but a really interesting one.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                In the rest of the video, the guy introduces some experts on the topic and
                they talk more about this particular phenomenon that happens when we try to
                measure the behavior of the electron. I must say that the talk becomes a
                little too complex and I wasn't able to understand everything but from all
                this talk I understand a little more how this phenomenon occurs and I must
                say that I am pretty excited about that because this is a topic that I
                found interesting and be able to understand it a little more day by day is
                something that truly puts a smile on my face.

                <b>The Quantum Conspiracy:</b> This talk has a pretty different approach than the
                other videos about quantum physics. The guy from this video tries to give
                like a different approach to the different myths (as he says) of quantum
                physics. He gives a different way of seeing the things, for example, he
                opens with the experiment of the slits and tries to explain how the
                interference occurs and how the mere act of try to measure this experiment
                will break the interference pattern because if you put some kind of
                observer the electron will know in some time of form and it will take a
                particular value.

                <b>Seth Lloyd on Programming the Universe:</b> The part that I liked more about
                this video is the first section when he talks about the importance of
                transferring information and how the mere universe does that in its own
                way. I found it pretty impressive how he starts to explain the importance
                and the evolution of transferring information, starting from the computer
                and going backward until, maybe, one of the first processes of transferring
                information; the big bang( or bit-bang, jokes). I must say that I found it
                pretty interesting this way of seeing the world as a continuous environment
                where the most important thing is to keep moving and keep sharing
                information.

                <b>Seth Lloyd on Quantum Machine Learning:</b> The first half of this video was
                pretty similar to the last part of the previous video of Seth (Programming
                the Universe). This part was a more technical talk about how the quantum
                computer works and the concept of the qubits and is something that is
                pretty interesting. Knowing these basic concepts gives me a good basic idea
                of how quantum computing works.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The last part of the video becomes a little complex to fully understand it
                but from that part, I learn that there are already some kinds of algorithms
                that can be used in quantum computation and they are a lot better than the
                ones from classical computation.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Another thing that I found pretty interesting is that from what I
                understand the way quantum computers manipulate data is pretty similar to
                the way that machine learning is supposed to manipulate data so there is a
                proposal of using quantum computing to create a better kind of Machine

                It is perfectly normal to fail when you are learning something new and even
                is perfectly normal to fail or make mistakes when you are a master of
                something, and it is very important to know how to tackle your failures,
                you can pretend that they were something normal or that is something that
                just happens and can't do anything about it(this approach doesn't work), or
                you can admit that you made a mistake and look how to change that.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">

                prove that your theory is wrong so that way you can fail in a more quickly

                view that looks like an amazing way of doing things because it looks like
                that way of work will lead you to know and do better things in a faster

                short time and you can see in just days or weeks if your idea is worth the
                effort and not only that, you can base that in actual data and not just

                something that can cause a lot of chaos but no, it actually looks that it
                can make things easier because it can make easier to know what and where

                a developer makes and make sure that it works in a proper way, and another
                thing that they do is to assure that all those new features have the
                capability to grow in the future. Is very interesting that it looks like
                the QA is in charge of the quality of the projects but at the same time
                they aren't because they will check and tell if something is bad or if it

                <b>I Don´t Test Often...:</b> From this video, I can say that I learned two new
                things; How complex the system of Netflix is and how hard it can be to make
                testing.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The first thing that really impresses me about this video is the complexity
                of the Netflix application, it reaches a point that is so bad that it is
                hard to know how all things work, and is pretty impressive the way that
                Netflix tackles this complexity. It looks like they give too much freedom
                to their developers but with those freedoms comes the responsibility too,
                it looks like every single development team is a little mechanism that only
                they know how they work and have the responsibility to work in a good way
                so all the big mechanisms work in a proper way. It looks like the rule of
                gold works for everything; “Divide and you will conquer”.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Another thing that I found very impressive is the way that Netflix tests
                his big and complex system, and I must say that it is pretty clever. So to
                test their own system, Netflix creates an army of monkeys(chaos monkey,
                chaos gorilla, kong, and others) with the only purpose to make his system
                delivery fail, and actually, it looks like something pretty clever because
                the system is so complex that it would be hard to test every single thing
                but if they create their own errors and then see where the problems come
                principally it will be easier to maintain the entire system.

                <b>Test Coverage:</b> A short but good talk. In this talk I learned about the
                concept of test coverage, I have never heard of it before, but it looks
                like a good tool that you can use when testing because it gives you more
                information about what is happening in the test and with more information,
                it is easier to know where exactly happens the error, therefore, the fix to
                that problem can happen in a quicker way.

                <b>The Testing User Experience:</b> From this video, I really get the importance
                of testing. I must say that I don't really have experience with all these
                testing things but after watching this video I think that I fully why is so
                important the testing phases, it helps a lot in the deployment because with
                the testing you ensure that the code will function even in a hard
                environment and not only that, thanks to the testing continuous testing you
                can more easily detecting a possible error in your code and in that way
                evade possible errors in the future.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I must say that I am not against the test phase but now I know why it is so

                <b>Breaking Things at Netflix:</b> This interview talks more about the technique
                that Netflix uses to test their software through failure and it continues
                to impress me this way of tackle the testing of your software because with
                this way of testing you do not assume that your software works perfectly
                and try to prove that, in this way of testing you assume that your software
                had errors and you try to find them to make a more robust software. I
                really love this idea of testing things in this way and it reminds me of
                one phrase from Richard Feynman; “We can never be right, we can only prove
                we are wrong”.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The next time that I test something I am gonna try to break it to prove
                this way of testing.

                something really necessary and after this talk, I see that I made a lot of

                use a shell so I installed one (git bash) and I am starting to use it more

                was really interesting to me, I have never had that vision of us(humans).
                It is really impressive to get the notion that we all want or need to be
                part of a group because that is the best way to survive. And I really like
                the idea of how to better develop a group, those tactics of given to the
                people like a feeling that all believe the same stuff and that we are all
                part of the same boat can be really helpful to create an outstanding
                community And I really like the tip of how to get rid of the people that
                just want to get carry for the team it was a pretty interesting one.

                <b>Creative thinking hacks:</b> This was a pretty interesting talk; I really like
                how this dude sees creativity like something you can work on and not
                something magical that sometimes you have and other times is gone and is
                when you feel “blocked”. Other things that I take from this talk are all
                the advice or hacks that he gives to know you more and work in a way that's
                the best for you and to increase your creativity. I really liked this talk
                because for much time I have the idea that creativity is something that you
                have or not and by now I am going to start working on my own creativity
                because it is something that is very important to have (at least for me).

                <b>Developing Expertise:</b> From this talk I had like how is the path of becoming
                an expert. We all start like a novice in the new things. We don't have to
                treat us like if we were experts since the beginning of the path and this
                is maybe something too hard to see because we usually follow instructions
                of an expert level but to follow that instruccion how they are supposed to
                you need a lot of experience.

                most from this talk is the way she sees the goals. I feel that she sees
                them as something that is possible, it doesn't matter what your goal is and
                how you are, the only thing that really matters is what you want and what
                you are gonna do to achieve it because even the more regular person could
                achieve big things. This thing is the thing that I like the most about this
                talk and is a perspective that I am gonna take for me and my goals.

                idea that ths video plant is something pretty interesting, the way that he
                sees the act of copying something is pretty interesting, I had never
                thought that copying something and transforming it can be something good
                because it can lead to innovation, and I am actually starting to think how
                could I apply this? How to copy and transform the things? and should I let
                others know the ideas or things I create? Because the copy of my own ideas
                could lead to the evolution of those. I must say that I found this video
                pretty interesting and it actually gave me some new perspectives to think

                <b>Test-Driven Development (TDD):</b> Is a technique for building software that

            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>Unit Testing:</b> Unit tests are low-level, focusing on a small part of the
                software system. Unit tests are written by the programmers. Unit tests are
                expected to be significantly faster than other kinds of tests.

                <b>Vim:</b> Vim is pretty interesting because the philosophy of this text editor
                is that you don't have to use any other thing that your keyboard to
                programma, that means; not use your mouse or even your arrow keys because
                these things will only slow you down in your programming task. I must say
                that I found pretty interesting this text editor because it looks like a
                real challenge to dominate it but it seems like it really payout once you
                have dominated.

                <b>Version Control:</b> After this reading, I really understand a little better
                how is that Git actually works and It makes me feel that a lot of things
                have more logic, for example, I didn't know that the commits are something
                immutable but know it makes sense why when you are trying to change
                something from a commit it is needed to create another new commit and it is
                impossible to edit an existing commit.

                video the guy talks about how important is to have an immediate
                representation of what you are doing because it will help you a lot in your
                process of create something, reducing the time in which you have and idea
                and see actually how it looks will be make your creativity more active.
                Another thing that is pretty important when you are creating something new
                is that you don't have to imaginate what you are doing, or at least is not
                recommended, because you are using a lot of concentration or brain capacity
                in thinking how the things you are doing will work or how they will look
                like.

                perspective of sean and doing the things sounds like something fun, I would
                love to work with that mentality of creating projects that inspired me and
                don't have to worry about how I will make that that give me money it truly
                sound like a fantasy but I think I am gonna start believing in Santa (how
                the guy say in the video). I am gonna start to give this perspective to my
                personal projects, I really feel that it will make the things more fun and
                even I think it would help me to be more creative at the moment in the
                things or projects that I really want to work on.

            </h2>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Here I would like to summarize all the things that I learned in the fourth
                week (October 19 – October 23) of the month.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                This week I learned more about testing, quantum computers and I even knew
                an interesting character called: Richard Feynman. This was a pretty
                interesting week so if you wanna see the full documentation go to the
                following link:

                <b>Richard Feynman:</b> This week I knew who Richard Feynman and I must say that I
                would like to have known him before because he was pretty interesting and a
                great scientist. The thing that I liked the most about him was his
                perspective about testing his theories (from the video of Scientific
                Method). As he said: “We can never be right, we can only prove we are
                wrong”, this is the thing that I take the most from him.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>The Pretotyping Manifesto:</b> I really enjoyed this video because it was some
                kind of mind blow to me because I really had the notion that the better way
                to prove if an idea is good is by the opinion of the people and if the
                majority of the people liked it, I jump immediately to make the prototype
                and oh man how wrong was I.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I really like the idea of the pretotyping thing because it helps you to
                create a quick demo of how your project will look and work but in a pretty
                short time and you can see in just days or weeks if your idea is worth the
                effort and not only that, you can base that in actual data and not just
                some opinion form different persons. I must say that I am kinda eager to
                start applying this way of working with new ideas for projects that I may
                have in the future.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>Tools for Continuous Integration at Google Scale:</b> In this video, I learned
                more about the way that the people of google works in some of their
                projects and the most interesting thing that I found from this way of work
                is that all work in just 1 branch (or even 2), it sounds like something
                that can cause a lot of chaos but no, it actually looks that it can make
                things easier because it can make easier to know what and where happened
                and error so is easier to fix.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                It was pretty interesting to see this different form of work in a project.
                It helps me to know that there is not just one way to do things( talking of
                development with a team), and I would like to try this method and the one
                that I am more familiar with to see which works better for me.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>Testing Engineering@Google:</b> From this talk, I learn more about how the
                testing process is and what the function of the QA department, or at least
                at Google. From what I learned, they are in charge of testing every feature
                that a developer makes and make sure that it works in a proper way, and
                another thing that they do is to assure that all those new features have
                the capability to grow in the future. Is very interesting that it looks
                like the QA is in charge of the quality of the projects but at the same
                time they aren't because they will check and tell if something is bad or if
                it can be improved but is a collective work to improve the quality of the
                final product.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>Test Coverage:</b> In this talk I learned about the concept of test coverage, I
                have never heard of it before, but it looks like a good tool that you can
                use when testing because it gives you more information about what is
                happening in the test and with more information, it is easier to know where
                exactly happens the error, therefore, the fix to that problem can happen in
                a quicker way.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                <b>I Don´t Test Often...:</b> From this video I can say that I learned two new
                things; How complex the system of Netflix is and how hard it can be to make
                testing.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The first thing that really impresses me about this video is the complexity
                of the Netflix application, it reaches a point that is so bad that it is
                hard to know how all things work, and is pretty impressive the way that
                Netflix tackles this complexity. It looks like they give too much freedom
                to their developers but with those freedoms comes the responsibility too,
                it looks like every single development team is a little mechanism that only
                they know how they work and have the responsibility to work in a good way
                so all the big mechanisms work in a proper way. It looks like the rule of
                gold works for everything; “Divide and you will conquer”.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Another thing that I found very impressive is the way that Netflix tests
                his big and complex system, and I must say that it is pretty clever. So to
                test their own system, Netflix creates an army of monkeys(chaos monkey,
                chaos gorilla, kong, and others) with the only purpose to make his system
                delivery fail, and actually, it looks like something pretty clever because
                the system is so complex that it would be hard to test every single thing
                but if they create their own errors and then see where the problems come
                principally it will be easier to maintain the entire system.

                    that this book helps me to remember somethings that I have to work on. The
                    ego is something I have been fighting against for a pretty long time and
                    sometimes I forgot that, so is good to read a book like this once in while,
                    and the things that I feel that I need to remember the most are the ones I
                    put in the list above, in that way I can come, read, and remember how
                    should I act against the ego.

                            from memory the greater the benefit of doing so”. Self quizzing is
                            a good technique to help you stick to the new things that you are
                            trying to learn because it will push you to try to retrieve the
                            data from your brain and the hardest that it is the more it sticks
                            with you. So Is good to test yourself from time to time.

                            A good way to self quizzing can be to recall all the key points from the

                            Interleaving: When you try to learn new things, don't focus just on
                            1 concept, try to learn at least 3 different concepts that share
                            some similarity in that way you will force your brain to find the

                            or practice it through different days. Don't do 50 exercises in 1
                            day, do 5 exercises every single day. Spacing can be between more
                            than one day, it can be even between weeks.

                    see what happens. I must say I am pretty eager to apply all those things
                    because well if I develop the ability to understand my mind and be able to
                    learn new things without a problem, what could stop me to reach and create
                    the thing that I want?.

                The basic concept of this way of work is that you will structure your

                a day and an hour, in that way you will have more control of what you will
                do at a certain time and just by reviewing your calendar you can easily see

                <b>Continuous Integration (CI):</b> This week I learned that the CI is like a way
                to do your work in the world of software development. The CI consists of
                having a method or a way in which you and your teammates can continually
                fusion their respective work and have the security that the result of this
                fusion will work.
            </p>

                <b>How to create a good pull request:</b> One of the things that I have learned in
                this week that I have been working with a team is that is important to have
                a good way of documenting all the things that you have done because it will
                help a lot to your team at understanding what you have done and it will
                make easier the job to the one who will continue from where you left. And
                one way to document your work is by having a good naming convention for
                your branches and a good description for your pull requests.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                In here I will list some tips to create a good pull request:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        A new branch should be created from the latest code of its

                    <p dir="ltr">

                will communicate between them and if you do it right it will make you
                easier create an application that interact with your database. There are
                three different types of relations: One-to-One, One-to-Many(or Many-to-One)
                and Many-to-Many.

                the movements that a account has made, in one hand you will have all the
                entries and in other place you will have all the exits that this account
                has made and to assure that the account has a good balance you need to
                minus the exits to the entries and the should give 0.

                when you are building something, it doesn't matter what, you have to be
                conscious that the bigger it grows it will become more complex and more
                susceptible to break and one of the best things to counter that is to make
                sure that whatever you are building has a robust structure.

                <b>The Optimism Bias:</b> I think this is a good talk because it gives you an idea
                of how to dream for better outcomes and make it happen. I must say that I
                am a pretty optimistic person, I have always liked to imagine and expect
                the best for me and my future but I am conscious that those things will not
                become real just because I dream them, I know I need to make something to
                make them happen. Something that has really helped me to go from just
                having a dream to making it something to happen is to create a realistic
                path I have to follow to make it happen and I just start to follow it.

                <b>Framework:</b> The framework keeps control of everything that is happening,
                prepares for you everything you need to work on something, and when you
                need to take action to do things, access your code to know what to do and
                take control of the situation.

                <b>Hadoop:</b> In a summarized way, Hadoop is a framework that is used for storing

                SQL queries to be implemented in the MapReduce Java API but this can become

                And to lose that common fear (at least that I have) of communicating with
                people in a new environment I already posted a question and It was answered
                pretty quick, I can say that it was a pretty simple communication but it
                was a good one.

                the end everything went pretty well and I am already able to work on the

                <b>Navigation Component (Android):</b> This week I worked on an Android project
                and one of the issues I worked on is related to the navigation in the app.
                Reading the code of this app I found out that they use the navigation
                component to manage the navigation of the app.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                The navigation component is a pretty useful tool that Android provides to
                make it easier to keep control of the navigation history of an application.
                Is something that is a must in your Android app if it has pretty complex
                navigation.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                One amazing thing about the navigation component is that it allows the
                developers to have a visual reference of how the activities are connected
                between them.

                <b>Language Compatibility (Android):</b> One of the issues I worked on this week
                was relational with the compatibility of an application with different
                languages. I investigated how android facilitates the developers to have
                multiple language support, and I found out that it is a pretty simple task
                but you have to put attention to the details because it can cause an
                unexpected error if you don't follow the guidelines for language
                compatibility.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                To be able to support different languages in your app you just need to have
                different resources where you store all the different values that a word
                can have, and to use them you just need to call that reference in your
                code, Android will do the rest of the work.

                <b>RTL (Android):</b> Right-To-Left languages. While I was working on an issue I
                found out that there exist languages that are reading from right to left,
                and I found out that Android provides pretty good help to the developers to
                make its application compatible with these languages.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                To make your application compatible with RTL you just need to make some
                configurations in your manifest and follow some guidelines for the design
                of the application. It sounds like something pretty easy but you need to be
                pretty methodic when you are designed the UI because if you don't follow
                the guidelines it will cause some unusual bugs, and to find out where and
                why is happening will be kinda complicated but once you found it, it will
                be pretty easy to fix (talking from experience because I worked on an issue
                related to this).

                <b>Preference (Android):</b> This is some kind of persistence data that we can use
                in Android. The preference is data that we can use to know how the user
                wants to interact with the app. These preferences are usually put in the
                Settings activity of an app.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                As you can imagine the preference is something that almost every
                application uses, so Android gives you some facilities to implement them in
                your app. It gives you some tools like; PreferenceScreen, Preference,
                SwitchPreferenceCompat, and a lot more things, to create your own Settings
                activity where the user can configure its experience with your app.

            <p dir="ltr">
                Reading about how Android allows you to implement your settings activity
                helped me to found a solution to one of the issues I worked on this week.

                and every single issue was totally different but they had something

            <p dir="ltr">
                This week I realize that the best way to start working on an issue is by
                first understanding how the project implements a function and understanding
                or at least having a good idea of how this function is implemented
                internally. I must say that reading the project I am working on, following
                the flow of the functions, and reading the documentation about the
                libraries that were used helped a lot to understand what was going on and
                how to solve the issue.

                research and understanding it, it was a lot easier to understand the

                <b>Generic Types (Java):</b> Generic types can be used to create methods or
                classes in Java. With these generic things, you can create a class or a
                method with a behavior that is not attached to a particular class. For
                example, you can create a Box class that can store any kind of object. The
                most common use of the generic types is the Collections, for example with
                one of the collections you can create a list of any type of object.

                has a similar goal that the generic types, you can use the "?" symbol when

                <b>JavaFx:</b> This week I had to make a research about how JavaFX works because
                the two issues I have been working on, demand the use of JavaFX, and I was
                struggling a lot at understanding how to use it but after watching some
                videos and read some documentation I understood in a better way how JavaFX
                works and now is becoming more easier to work in my current project.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                Key points I learned about JavaFx:

                    <p dir="ltr">

                    <p dir="ltr">
                        The fxml files are used to create the interfaces, these files use a
                        variation of XML

                : The challenge in this issue has been something more technical. To be able
                to make progress in this issue I have had to make a lot of research. I
                haven't code yet a solution for this issue but thanks to this issue I have
                been learning a lot of new things and concepts that will not only help me
                for this project, for example, I learned more about the pattern MVVM and it
                is something that is I used to in Android Jetpack. Actually, most of the
                things that I learned this week were thanks to this issue.
