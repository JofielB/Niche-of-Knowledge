                <b>How to Talk to Anyone </b>: This reading is like a review of the book; How to
                Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes and in this reading you can find the things
                that the author of those notes thought that were more important from the
                book. The things that I found more interesting about all the advices that
                this book has to offer are the next ones:
            </p>
            <ul>

                    <p dir="ltr">
                        It is important to know even how to smile. It is not recommended to
                        always smile immediately when you know a new person, you have to
                        wait for the perfect moment to give it a more genuine smile.

                        Eye contact is very important to always have eye contact and if you
                        have a lot of problems with that you can watch the nose or the
                        eyebrows of the person you are speaking to.

                        You need to be as relaxed as possible, don’t make unnecessary
                        movements because it can lead to bad misunderstandings.

                        The conversation needs to flow first into your heart then you speak
                        and if you don’t know how to answer you can ask about the last
                        thing the other said to continue the conversation.
                    </p>

                        Match the mood of the ones you are speaking to, for example if they
                        are too calm try to speak in a calmer way or if they are too
                        excited try to transmit that same emotion when you speak.

                        The more you know about the better the conversations will be. It is

                good but these are the things that I take more from the lecture.

                        Simplicity not speed: When you are working on a program the most
                        important thing is to make the program to work properly and you
                        have to make the code as simple as possible and don’t use a complex
                        algorithm because it may help do the task more quickly but it makes
                        it harder to maintain and expand that code.

                        are going to use or maintain but if you are having trouble
                        understanding something don’t just assume how it works, it is
                        better if you approach a college and ask.

                <b>X Workflow</b>: Well this lecture is like a recommendation about how to do your
                work in more properly an efficient way, the lecture talks about the
                differences phases that you need to go through to tackle all the problems
                in a better way. I really liked all this recommendations because I totally
                agreed with them, when you are trying to resolve a problem first you have
                to find what’s the problem and then you have to give a proper analyze to
                the problem not just jump immediately to do the thing that you suppose will
                resolve the problem, only when you have made the proper analysis you can go
                to the next phase and this is something that you need to do for al phases
                you need to take the proper time and advance one step at a time to work and
                resolve the problems in a better way.

                <b>Missing semester</b>: The linux shell: This was a pretty good read. I really
                learned more about how the shell works. I already knew the basics of the
                shell, that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the pat variables and
                the shell are connected and I found pretty that pretty cool, now I know
                that I am stalling sqlite(for example) and use the command sqlite3 in my
                cmd and I receive a message saying that the command is unrecognizable it
                may be a problem with the path variable.

                was really interesting to me, I have never had that vision of us(humans).
                It is really impressive to get the notion that we all want or need to be
                part of a group because that is the best way to survive. And I really like
                the idea of how to better develop a group, those tactics of given to the
                people like a feeling that all believe the same stuff and that we are all
                part of the same boat can be really helpful to create and outstanding
                community And I really like the tip of how to get rid of the people that
                just want to get carry for the team it was a pretty interesting one.

                <b>Creative thinking hacks</b>: This was a pretty interesting talk; I really like
                how this dude sees creativity like something you can work on and not
                something magical that sometimes you have and other times is gone and is
                when you feel “blocked”. Other things that I take from this talk are all
                the advice or hacks that he gives to know you more and work in a way that's
                the best for you and to increase your creativity. I really liked this talk
                because for much time I have the idea that creativity is something that you
                have or not and by now I am going to start working on my own creativity
                because it is something that is very important to have (at least for me).

                        for success you really need to see yourself, to see where you are
                        and how much power you have to success in your goal, if your
                        current power is not enough you need to crave from ways to earn
                        more power or to have smaller goal that require less power which

                        failing is learning, try new ways to tackle the problem until you

                <b>Composition</b>: From my point of view the composition is kinda similar to the
                Inheritance because you use other class attributes and methods to fulfill a
                purpose but with the difference that the classes that you use are not
                attached to the classes that use them. For example, if you have the method
                or process of walk in the Persona class and you want to use that method in
                a class called Alumno you only instantiate the class Persona on the Alumno
                class and use the methods or attributes that you need in this way the
                Alumno class is not directed attached to the class Persona.

                advantage of the OOP paradigm:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Abstraction: This consists in obtaining the more particular or
                        general attributes from an object and creating a class in base of
                        them. Is very important to just abstract the more essential
                        attributes of a class to make it possible to use in many
                        situations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Encapsulation: The encapsulation make reference to the liberty that
                        other classes have to access to the attributes and methods of the
                        other classes, for example if you are using a class called people
                        you will be able to access to its public methods or attributes, for
                        example let's said that the class has a attribute name and is
                        public you will be able to use it but if the class has an attribute
                        called id and is private your will not be able to use it.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Inheritance: This is the ability to inherit the methods and
                        attributes from one class to another.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p dir="ltr">
                        Polymorphism: This pillar is holding hands from the inheritance one
                        because to have polymorphism is necessary to have inheritance. For
                        example, if you have a class called Car with the basic attributes
                        and methods that a car could have you can create a class called
                        Bocho or Troca that could inherit the basic methods and attributes
                        that a car has and implement them in its own way. In this way all
                        the cars would have the same methods but implemented in different
                        ways or forms.

                <b>The Myth of the Genius Programmer</b>: To me the principal point of this talk
                is to make you see that the perfect programmer doesn’t exist, there is no
                such people that can write perfect programs at the first try and never make
                a mistake so you don’t have to fear to fail and that people see you how you
                fail.

                I really like this talk because I really have that feeling that all the
                thing I do have to be perfect or at least work as there are supposed to in
                the first try but not because I fear to make a mistake is more about the
                fear of don’t be to the expectation but well the things that the talk are
                pretty true, you don’t be perfect at the first try and you don’t have to be
                just keep trying and you fail that’s good, that means that there are thing
                that you can improve and now know that you fail you know what thing you
                need to improve.

                <b>Variable Length Codes</b>: This video teaches you about how the transition of

                explaining the basic concepts of the transition of information, it explains
                how all start with the creation of the telegraph and the invention of the
                morse code and now evolve to the use of binary code to transmit

                because it focused on how to behave in a company. And I must say that it is
                pretty interesting that the kind of environment that they describe in the
                talk is pretty similar to the environment of Encora(Or at least I saw it
                like that) because they talk of an environment when you are free and
                responsible for yourself and your work.

                its was kinda different to other talks because they are answering like some
                questions about some problems that came when you are working in a team but
                most of the question are focused on how things are when you are working
                with people, when you work with a team, how to collaborate with people that
                collaborate with you but are outside of your team and they talk about how
                to talk to other people that are not directly resalionate with the project

                <b>Developing Expertise</b>: From this talk I had like how is the path of becoming
                an expert. We all start like a novice in the new things. We don't have to
                treat us like if we were experts since the beginning of the path and this
                is maybe something too hard to see because we usually follow instructions
                of an expert level but to follow that instruccion how they are supposed to
                you need a lot of experience.

                <b>Perfection is an unrealistic goal</b>: This talk was really uhm calm I must
                said, I really liked the topic because I feel that the things that are said
                I can use it not just in my work environment. How she says and the end,
                don't try to dry a swap just kill the alligator. I really like that
                perspective of seeing things, like in a more relaxed and agile way, is good
                to want it all but be calm, plant the things and one little step at a time.
                This is something that I am gonna try to implement in my life.

                recommendations in a lot of places.

                <b>The power of an Agile Mindset</b>: I must say that the thing that I like the

                them as something that is possible, it doesn't matter what your goal is and
                how you are, the only thing that really matters is what you want and what
                you are gonna do to achieve it because even the more regular person could
                achieve big things. This thing is the thing that I like the most about this

                <b>Everything is a remix(set of videos)</b>: Everything is a remix, new ideas come
                from old one and all new things are inspirations from their ancestors. The
                idea that ths video plant is something pretty interesting, the way that he
                sees the act of copying something is pretty interesting, I had never
                thought that copying something and transforming it can be something good
                because it can lead to innovation, and I am actually starting to think how
                could I apply this? How to copy and transform the things? and should I let
                others know the ideas or things I create? Because the copy of my own ideas
                could lead to the evolution of those. I must say that I found this video
                pretty interesting and it actually gave me some new perspectives to think

                <b>Missing semester</b>: This was a pretty good video and reading. I really learned
                more about how the shell works. I already knew the basics of the shell,
                that is like an interface between you and your computer and you can
                interact with your computer through some commands but for example I didn’t
                know the importance of the Path. I knew that the path variables were
                important but before reading this I didn’t knew how the pat variables and
                the shell are connected and I found pretty that pretty cool, now I know
                that I am stalling sqlite(for example) and use the command sqlite3 in my
                cmd and I receive a message saying that the command is unrecognizable it
                may be a problem with the path variable.
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">
                I must said that after this video I am gonna start using more a shell
